The components here form the basis of the Vypr Design System that powers the <a href="https://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn" target="_blank">Vypr homepage</a>, one of the products that Golden Frog offers.</p><p class="c-section__content">Atomic design is critical to understanding the breakdown of scope for CSS within the components. To create a sense of "scope" for CSS, the prinicipals of atomic design can be applied. The most basic compoonents (atoms) have no scope. As atoms are assembled into molecules, the context of the molecule will add a new CSS class to the element for that given scope. As molecules are assembled into organisms, the same rules of context apply.</p></section></template>
